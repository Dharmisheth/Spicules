                <p>In the dynamic realm of product development, delivering a top-quality product is a paramount goal for every product owner. However, achieving this goal requires careful planning, especially in the fast-paced business environment where time-to-market and ROI often take precedence over Quality Assurance (QA). In this blog, weâ€™ll delve into the nuances of QA and Quality Control (QC), shedding light on their distinctions and emphasizing the importance of incorporating QA processes for successful product development. </p>
                <h1 className="text-[27px] font-bold tracking-tight mt-7 text-blue-800">
                    Understanding Quality Assurance (QA) </h1>
                <p className="mt-3">QA is a systematic, proactive process integral to product development. It involves continuous testing and re-testing throughout the development lifecycle to identify and rectify defects before the final product reaches clients. QA ensures that the product meets specified requirements, focusing on aspects such as reliability, design, performance, and robustness. Employing preventive strategies, QA is a key player in early defect detection, aligning with seven fundamental testing principles.</p>
                <h1 className="text-[27px] font-bold tracking-tight mt-7 text-blue-800">
                    Differentiating QA from QC  </h1>
                <p className="mt-3">While QA is a preventive approach, QC operates reactively or correctively. QA addresses issues early in the development process, preventing the need for extensive post-production fixes. QC, as a subset of QA, becomes necessary when defects have not been adequately addressed in the QA phase. It is crucial to recognize that QA and QC work in tandem, with QA laying the foundation for optimal quality at the time of delivery.</p>
